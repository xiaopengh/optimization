        \item Let \(d_B(a) = \inf_{b \in B} \|a-b\|\) be the distance from the point \(a\) to the set \(B\).
            Since \(B\) is closed, the infimum is attained at some point \(b^\ast \in B\), and it depends on choice of \(a\) i.e.,
            \[
                d_B(a) = \|a-b_a^\ast\|.
            \]
            Since \(A\) is compact, the function \(d_B\) is continuous on \(A\) and attains its minimum at some point \(a^\ast \in A\).
            Therefore, a minimizer of the original problem exists.
        \item If neither \(A\) nor \(B\) is compact,
